Here are 10 conditional function ideas you can practice in Python:

1. **Check Even or Odd**: Write a function that takes a number as input and checks whether it is even or odd.

2. **Grade Calculator**: Create a function that accepts a percentage as input and returns the grade based on the following conditions:
   - 90-100: A
   - 80-89: B
   - 70-79: C
   - Below 70: F

3. **Leap Year Checker**: Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

4. **Eligibility for Voting**: Create a function that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

5. **Positive, Negative, or Zero**: Write a function that takes a number as input and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero.

6. **Password Strength Checker**: Create a function that checks the strength of a password based on conditions like length, inclusion of numbers, and special characters.

7. **Find the Largest Number**: Write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the largest one.

8. **Check Divisibility**: Create a function that checks whether a number is divisible by another number.

9. **Triangle Validity Checker**: Write a function to check if three given sides can form a valid triangle (sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).

10. **Simple Login System**: Create a function that checks if the username and password entered by the user match predefined values. If both match, display "Login successful"; otherwise, show "Access denied."

These exercises will help you get comfortable with Python conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
